"The Da Vinci Code" by Dan Brown (my favourite author) is a fast-paced, suspenseful thriller that combines elements of art, history, and religion to create an intriguing and captivating story. Published in 2003, the novel quickly became a worldwide bestseller and has since spawned a successful film adaptation.
