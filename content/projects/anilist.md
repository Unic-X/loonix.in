**Anilist-Post-Ext** is a browser extension designed for Chromium-based applications that automatically syncs the anime a user is watching to their Anilist page. Here’s an overview:

### Core Functionality
- **Automatic Sync:** Integrates with popular anime websites like Gogoanime and Animpahe to track the anime currently being watched.
- **Anilist Integration:** Uses GraphQL to interact with the Anilist API and update the user’s watching status directly on their Anilist profile.

### Technologies Used
- **JavaScript:** The primary language for developing the extension’s functionality and interactions.
- **GraphQL:** Used for querying and updating data on the Anilist platform.

### Use Cases
- Seamlessly update anime watching status on Anilist without manual input.
- Enhance user experience by automating the synchronization process across different anime streaming platforms.

This project highlights the ability to integrate web technologies with external APIs to create a smooth and automated user experience in tracking and managing anime watching activities.
