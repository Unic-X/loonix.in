**Wator-Simulation** is a population dynamics simulation developed using C, demonstrating the interactions between two species in a virtual ecosystem. Hereâ€™s an overview:


### Core Functionality
- Simulate the behavior of two species (e.g., fish and sharks) in a grid environment.
- Use OpenGL for rendering and visualizing the simulation.
- Implement multi-threading to manage and update the simulation efficiently.

### Multi-Threading Implementation
- **Thread Creation:** Used multiple threads to handle different aspects of the simulation concurrently. For example, one thread updates the positions and interactions of species, while another handles the rendering and user inputs.
- **Synchronization:** Implemented synchronization mechanisms (such as mutexes) to manage access to shared resources and prevent race conditions.
- **Concurrency Management:** Ensured that threads work efficiently together by dividing the simulation tasks into independent units that could be processed in parallel. This approach improved the responsiveness and performance of the simulation.

### Use Cases
- Studying population dynamics and interactions in a controlled environment.
- Educational purposes for understanding ecological and computational models.


### Technologies Used
- **C:** The programming language used for developing the simulation logic.
- **OpenGL:** Provides graphics rendering and visualization.


This project illustrates the application of C programming and graphical technologies to model complex systems and dynamics in a visually engaging way, with a focus on leveraging multi-threading for enhanced performance and efficiency.
