## Cryptography is thrilling Blockchain isn't.

First off, thank you for taking the time to read this. In an era where attention is a rare commodity, your interest and curiosity mean a lot.

Whenever I mention "crypto," I’m always talking about cryptography in general—not cryptocurrency. Unfortunately, most people assume otherwise unless I’m annoyingly specific. This widespread misconception speaks volumes about the narratives dominating our digital age.

This self-deprecating thought often loops in my mind. But is it true? Grades and academic accolades measure many things—discipline, consistency, perhaps even a knack for playing the system—but do they truly measure knowledge, especially in a domain as nuanced as cryptography?

### Projects: The Double-Edged Sword
People frequently argue that real knowledge stems from making projects. While there's truth in this, it depends on how those projects are made. If you're building something monumental from scratch, wrestling with the foundational layers of the technology, sure—you’re growing. But if your so-called "project" is just a thin wrapper around ten layers of abstraction, calling a simple API, is it really yours?

### Grades Aren't the Real Metric
Either Cryptography or Blockchain, at its core, demands a curiosity-driven pursuit of knowledge, something grades or pre-built frameworks can hardly encapsulate. True understanding comes from digging into the math, appreciating the elegance of algorithms, and experiencing the frustration of breaking and building systems.

We need to foster a culture where exploration and failure are seen as integral to the process. Grading systems often fail to measure these aspects, focusing instead on memorization.

## Closing Thoughts
This isn't to say academic success or polished projects are without merit—they have their place. But for anyone passionate about technology, remember: grades or fancy project portfolios are just one side of the story. To truly learn, go beyond. Read more for yourself, and challenge your own understanding.

*Let’s stop measuring knowledge by shallow metrics and start valuing the depth of exploration.*
