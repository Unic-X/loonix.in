In recent months, I've had a recurring thought: Is most corporate software engineering just glorified bricklaying? Aside from low-level systems and open-source work, much of the modern tech world feels more like assembly-line labor than true engineering. Here's why that feeling may be more justified than you'd think.

### 1. Repetition Over Innovation

In most corporate environments:

- You're not inventing new algorithms or designing protocols.
- You're wiring APIs, tweaking configs, building CRUD applications.
- You solve the same types of problems that have already been solved a thousand times before.

> This starts to feel like digital **brick-and-mortar work**. It’s necessary for the coorporation, sure but not exactly intellectually stimulating.

### 2. Business Goals Kill Technical Depth

Companies aren’t incentivized to pursue technical elegance or novelty. Their goal is **revenue, growth, and stability**.

- Features are driven by product timelines, not innovation.
- Engineers are measured by delivery speed, not architectural soundness.
- Most projects avoid deep exploration because they just need to *work*, not *inspire*.

Your job becomes one of **maximizing output, not maximizing understanding**.

> Still, not all corporate work is shallow. Companies like Meta, Google, and Red Hat often push technical boundaries in infra, distributed systems, and privacy. These teams tackle real engineering challenges but they’re usually buried deep within org charts, far from the routine feature work most engineers face.

### 3. Modern Abstractions Remove the Need to Think Deeply

The tech stack today is high-level and pre-assembled:

- Want a backend? Use Node.js + Express.
- Need scalable messaging? Just install Kafka or NATS.
- Deploy to the cloud? Use Docker and Kubernetes.

But few engineers understand how these tools work under the hood. Why? Because they don’t need to. The abstractions work until they don’t. But relying too much on them results in **mental atrophy**. 

>You're no longer solving deep problems, you're **assembling prefabricated parts**.

---

### 4. Specialization Makes You Replaceable

Most large organizations emphasize narrow roles:

- API engineers write endpoints.
- Frontend devs wire Figma to React.
- DevOps builds pipelines from Terraform scripts.

Few understand the full system, and even fewer shape it.

>This siloing makes it easy to **swap people out** just like a construction site. Your value becomes tied to your **task velocity**, not your **systems thinking** or **creative problem-solving**.

---

### 5. True Engineering Happens Elsewhere

Contrast the corporate world with:

- Writing compilers or kernel modules.
- Implementing consensus algorithms from scratch.
- Building from the metal up  file systems, protocols, emulators.
- Contributing meaningfully to open source projects that push boundaries.

>These aren't “product tickets.” They are technical adventures. **This is where engineering thrives.**

## Conclusion: Yes, It Often Is Digital Bricklaying

✅ The work maybe useful.  
✅ The work maybe valued.  
❌ But it’s not usually deep.  
❌ It’s rarely novel.  
❌ It doesn’t stretch most engineers intellectually.

>If you’re someone who got into tech for the **curiosity**, the **craftsmanship**, or the **puzzle-solving**, this kind of work will eventually feel hollow.

*Thanks for reading. If you’ve ever felt this way too, or if you’re navigating this journey, I’d love to hear from you.*
